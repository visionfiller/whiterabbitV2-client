# White Rabbit

The purpose of this app is to gain wine knowledge for the novice wine drinker. It contains a library of basic wines, with a search functionality, and recommended wines based on user selections. It also contains a social media aspect where the user can view other users favorites, and send messages.

## Description

A digital wine sommelier where the admin user can submit a wine through a form that takes the wine name, wine region/varietal, vintage, and image. and this compares the region and varietal to the current database that has the region/varietal and returns the information based on that object. it also takes the foreign keys on the region varietal such as dryness, flavor profile, and body. and returns similar region varietals to what the user submitted. the user can then save the submission as an object (favorite wines) and then it gets added to a list of user favorites, and based on this list, the app will automatically make wine suggestions based on past submissions.
